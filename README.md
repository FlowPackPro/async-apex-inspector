# Async Apex Inspector

Async Apex Inspector is a small application to view Salesforce Async Apex Jobs in a visual timeline chart to help better understand
when, how often, and for how long background Apex jobs are running. With this view, Salesforce admins, developers, and
architects can easily identify areas for optimization and improvement with background Apex jobs. Additionally, it can
be used to find available times to schedule batch jobs.
